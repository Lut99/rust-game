# rust-game: Vulkan game development in Rust
A repository containing various Rust-crates that are useful for game development with [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/).

## Crates
Currently, the repository contains the follow crates:
- `rust-ecs`: An Entity Component System for Rust.
- `rust-vk`: A RAII-wrapper in Rust for [ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash) bindings.
- `rust-win`: Provides a wrapper implementation about a [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) window and related Vulkan strucst (depends on the `rust-vk` crate).

You can learn more about each repository by visiting their respective folder (which has the same name).


## Installation
To use a crate in this repository, add it to your `Cargo.toml` file using the git-link of the repository as a whole:
```toml
rust-vk = { git = "https://github.com/Lut99/rust-game" }
```
It is a workspace, so Cargo will select the appropriate crate in this whole workspace. You can replace `rust-vk` with any of the other packages in this crate.

Optionally, you can select a specific version of the crate by adding a specific tag:
```toml
rust-win = { git = "https://github.com/Lut99/rust-game", tag = "<TAG>" }
```
where `<VERSION>` is the desired tag to use.

Note that this crate uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) that is separate from the individual crates. That means that any breaking change will always be reflected in the major version number.


## Usage
The documentation of this workspace and all its crates may be automatically generated by running:
```bash
cargo doc
```
in the source of this crate. Then, in your browser, navigate to:
```
file://<path-to-repo>/target/doc/<crate>/index.html
```
where `<path-to-repo>` is the path to where you cloned the repository and `<crate>` is the crate name you wish to inspect. Note, however, that in the latter case all **dashes need to be replaced with dots** (see the README files of individual crates to see examples).

You can then browse the documentation at your leisure.
