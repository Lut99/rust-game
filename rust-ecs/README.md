# rust-ecs: An Entity Component System in Rust
A (simple) Entity Component System in Rust that may be used for multiple projects.


## Installation
To use this crate in one of your projects, simply add:
```toml
rust-ecs = { git = "https://github.com/Lut99/rust-game" }
```
to your `Cargo.toml` file.

Optionally, you can select a specific version by adding:
```toml
rust-ecs = { git = "https://github.com/Lut99/rust-game", tag = "<TAG>" }
```
where `<TAG>` is the desired version number of the `rust-game` repository.

Note that this crate uses semantic versioning. That means that any breaking change will always be reflected in the major version number.
